Here is the summary from the previous developer, please check and confirm if all good

Here is the remaining things to complete the project:
1) The source code of the Smart Contract is in CC in the afrik-invest-contract.zip project, the implementation is a V1 which does not take everything into account. Contracts should be improved over time.



2) Create an API key on Coingecko ( https://www.coingecko.com/fr/api/documentation)
- (backend) Use the endpoints /coins/list to get the ID of the coins accepted in Afrikinvest, then call /simple/price with the ID to get the current price
- (frontend) https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-frontend/blob/11b13afcc1531f76b96e06eaff98f613665a9ee7/src/pages/swap.tsx#L968 : in frontend, Integrate the mini graph, possibility to take inspiration from Raydium's implementation with the KLineChart() component

3) (backend) Setup of the Mongo database with the backup of the csv files :
Example of Mongo commands to make the import : mongoimport -d database_name -c collection_name --type csv --file locations.csv --headerline
- (backend) Once this step done, you need to add a Repository class to retreive the data then give send this data to the frontend
- (frontend) Modify frontend for dynamic sales display



4) (frontend) Finalize the authentification using the Metamask crypto wallet, lyou can use this library https://github.com/jacobedawson/connect-metamask-react-dapp

Abdoulaye BA 8:06 AM

In case of git issue, the project is also downloadable via this zip : https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AKHCBJ9zrzzy38U&cid=6A9501BECEBE5ACB&id=6A9501BECEBE5ACB%2152179&parId=6A9501BECEBE5ACB%21104&action=locate

Levi Driessen 8:19 AM
OK, sure. I will wait.

I want you to make a right decision.

Abdoulaye BA 8:21 AM
Thanks Levi, appreciate that

Which plugin can we use, to convert crypto payment to fiat ?

Levi Driessen 8:25 AM
we can use zonda-pay to convert crypto into EUR.

maybe you have your own idea?

Abdoulaye BA 8:26 AM
The previous developer was talking about bitpay

Levi Driessen 8:27 AM
Ah, bitpay. well, that's not bad.

if you want that, then I will try.

But Bitpay has more paymentcommission.

Anyway, I will try that you wanted. or if I have to make a decision, then I will use zonda.

Levi Driessen 8:38 AM
What about bitstamp?

that is most popular today with user-friendly interface and fulltime support.

Abdoulaye BA 8:40 AM
okay, why not, we can try bitstamp

Levi Driessen 8:42 AM
so is your interview with others going well?

Abdoulaye BA 8:43 AM
just few things to check, I have a meeting now, I will come back to you this evening

Levi Driessen 8:45 AM
OK, wish you good luck.

Abdoulaye BA 8:51 AM
