What language do you prefer to use with React: TypeScript or JavaScript and why?

I prefer TypeScript than JavaScript.
It's because :
1.TypeScript code is more reliable and easier to refactor. This enables me to evade errors and do rewrites much easier.
2.In large-scale systems, it is important to be able to abstract away the rest of the system while keeping the context in mind. Types enable us to do that.
