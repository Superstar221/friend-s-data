Hi, Hope you are doing well!

Your job post stood out to me because it's extremely similar to the work Iâ€™ve provided to many clients before.
My extensive experience in MERN stack + web3.js matches well with your requirements.
In addition, I worked for several clients such as Compound, 0x, Pylon, so I'm happy to work for such a good client with a long-term relationship.

Here are some previous projects built using React and web3.js.
 - https://pylon.finance
 - https://pylon.finance/oldfarms
 - https://dondi.io
My role in these projects was as a frontend developer,
I developed the frontend webpage using React and web3.js
The most challenging part was an overflow issue from multiple operations of uint256*uint256 variables and I couldn't get any good ideas from Stackoverflow.com. Finally, I solved the problem by making a module of string multiplication large numbers. Also, I advised my client to build this amazing product in the frontend and smart contract parts.
