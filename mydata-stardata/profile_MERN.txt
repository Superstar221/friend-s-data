MERN Dev 

Hello!
Before talking about qualifications and professional abilities, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Edward Hartman. Taking web development as a profession not only fulfills my pocket but also my heart because it has been my passion since my early teenage.

I believe that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays. That’s why I chose freelance web development as my career because I believe I am good at this and I am always honest and I am never afraid of doing hard work.

I have finished my graduation from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) on Information retrieval and I have taken many lessons on modern web developing from famous institutions. My education background allowed me to thrive in this career and my trainings on this have made me a master of this section.

I am an outstanding expert in both frontend and backend developing. Especially ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap/jQuery are my top skills. I have developed various websites to optimize their search engines and to create easier user interfaces.

Recently, I have developed a website that helps small and medium sized businesses trade internationally with digital trade finance, and the website has become very popular among companies. The name of the website is https://www.modifi.com. The mobile app of the website was also created by me which has a high rating on google store.

This is just one of my successful stories as a freelance web developer. I am sure that if you hire me, I will present you many successful projects with minimal efforts from your side. Also, I can give you money back guarantee and I can assure you won’t regret hiring me.
Thank you.
